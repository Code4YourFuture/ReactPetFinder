PetFinder with React!

For this project we are going to use React to create an app much like an animal adoption agency. This tutorial will go over the basics skills of React including:

Components
Hooks (useEffect, useState)
Routing using react-router-dom
Handling Forms in React

By no means is this an exhaustive list of React topics, but it's designed to be a fun introduction to the framework. 

To run the app, be sure to do npm run dev. This will run the backend and React at the same time using concurrently.

If you clone the repo be sure to do npm install. The backend is being mocked using json-server so we do not have to build a separate API. Feel free to play around
with db.json to see different data on the screen.
