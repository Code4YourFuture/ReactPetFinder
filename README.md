Pet Finder React App Tutorial üê∂üê±

Welcome to the Pet Finder React app tutorial repository! This project is designed to help budding developers learn the intricacies of React by building a comprehensive pet adoption website.
Getting Started

To get the app up and running on your local machine, follow these instructions:
Prerequisites

Before starting the app, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
Dependencies

This project relies on several key dependencies:

    json-server: Used to mock a REST API for our application.
    concurrently: Allows us to run multiple commands concurrently.
    react-router-dom: Enables routing capabilities within our React app.
    axios: A popular promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests.

To install these dependencies, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

npm install json-server concurrently react-router-dom axios

Starting the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the app with the following command:

npm run dev

This command will run both the frontend and the mock backend concurrently.
